Making an Organization public you expose it to the world. Everyone out there can open it and walk through your fancy Office Space. But only the Members with priviliges can alter it.
This is very suitable and convenient in many scenarios like:

* You're a Co-working space that want to share it's Office Rooms and Desks publicly;
* You're an Organization like University, School, Dorm or any Entity that is open to the public;
* You're a Office Leasing Company that want to share it's Office Space with the potential customers;
* You're an open company that loves it's Office and want to share the pride with the world;
* Or you just love the Openness.
