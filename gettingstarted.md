# Start with an Organization or with a Room
Once you sign up with Officernd, you will be prompted to create your first [Organization](/concepts.html#Organization) or [Room](/concepts.html#Room).
How to start depends mostly on your preference at the time you start using Officernd. If you only need to design a single room and share it the friends, co-workers or the entire world, you'd better (start with a simple Room)[#room). 
If you, on the other side, plan to set up your entire Organization structure, well, you'd better go for an [Organization](#organization). It will give you the whole flexibility Officernd is capable of.
