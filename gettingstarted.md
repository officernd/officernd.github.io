# Start with an Organization or with a Room
Once you sign up with Officernd, you will be prompted to create your first [Organization](/concepts.html#Organization) or [Room](/concepts.html#Room).
How to start depends mostly on your preference at the time you start using Officernd. If you only need to design a single room and share it the friends, co-workers or the entire world, you'd better [start with a simple Room](#room). 
If you, on the other hand, plan to set up your entire Organization structure with all the [Offices](/concepts.html#Office), [Rooms](/concepts.html#Room), [Members](/concepts.html#Member) and [Desks](/concepts.html#Desk), well, you'd better go and set up an [Organization](#organization). 
It will give you the the flexibility Officernd is capable of.

## <a name='organization'></a>Set up an Organization
At this stage, you can choose to start from empty Organization, by just following the 'Create Organization' link, or you may choose to start from _Sample Organization_. 
The second option will create your own Organization with 2 beautiful Offices each having 2 Rooms in it. This sample Organization will give you smoother Getting started experience, so you can focus on your own offices, rooms and desks.
Once you name your Organization (Please note that the name should be **Unique**. Once you create Organization with a name, you will have reserved URL for it.), you may enter a bit more info about it at the _Settings_ tab.
